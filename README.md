This section aims to reanalyze the data retrived from a publication by Griffith et al. (2015).

TODO:

- [x] retrieve and extract data: reference genome (.fasta), reads (.fastq), annotation file (.gff)
- [x] generate reference index (.idx)
- [x] align reads to reference (.sam)
- [x] convert SAM to BAM (.bam)
- [x] generate index for BAM files
- [ ] OPTIONAL: convevrt BAM to bigWig for visualization
- [x] count overlapping alignments (count matrix)
- [x] standardize count matrix
- [x] run statistical model for analyzing counts
- [x] produce heat map from standardized counts
